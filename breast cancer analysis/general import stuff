Goal: create SVM algorithm for Breast Cancer Wisconsin set and use neural network for analysis

Ranking variables:
primarily use TNM (tumor, node, metastasis)

Tumor
-size = area_mean -> direct correlation
Node and metastasis
-compactness = compactness_mean -> if tumor is bunched up in one place, then worse impact
-texture = texture_mean -> bumpy is scarier
-concavity = concavity_mean (more concavity -> inwards -> scarier, more unnatural)
